# Data-Driven HR Solutions: Turnover and Performance

## Project Overview
This project analyzes employee turnover and performance data to uncover key factors affecting job satisfaction, work-life balance, and turnover causes. It includes data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and recommendations for improving HR policies.

## Project Goals
- Identify factors contributing to employee turnover.
- Analyze trends in performance, job satisfaction, and diversity.
- Provide actionable insights through dashboards and visualizations.

## Main Components
### 1. Data Cleaning
- **Step 1:** Remove missing values and duplicates for accuracy.
- **Step 2:** Drop unnecessary columns that are irrelevant to the analysis.
- **Step 3:** Standardize values, replacing "Non-Binary" and "Prefer not to say" in the `Gender` column with `NULL`.

### 2. Data Analysis
- Created an SQL database to investigate:
  - Employee distribution across racial groups to detect bias.
  - Relationships between overtime hours and salaries.
  - Gender inequality in salaries and job opportunities.
- Visualized the data using Excel for insights on attrition and hiring practices.

### 3. Dashboards and Visualizations
- Highlighted:
  - Job categories with overtime requirements and their salary trends.
  - Work-life balance improvements and their impact on productivity.
  - Company efforts in providing training and addressing fairness in hiring.

## Tools Used
- **Python:** For data cleaning and preprocessing.
- **SQL Server:** For advanced relational analysis.
- **Excel:** For data visualization and trend analysis.
- **Power BI:** For creating dashboards.

## Key Insights
- Jobs requiring overtime tend to have lower average salaries.
- Younger managers are hired based on competence rather than years of service.
- Training opportunities are increasing but need better alignment with skill gaps.

## Suggestions
- Offer incentives for overtime work and targeted training.
- Promote flexible and remote work policies.
- Focus on anti-racism programs and fair hiring practices.
